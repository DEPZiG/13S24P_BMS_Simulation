# 13S24P_BMS_Simulation
Simulink-based Battery Management System for a 13S24P Lithium-Ion Pack

# Advanced Battery Management System (BMS) for a 13S24P Lithium-Ion Pack

## Overview
This project develops a Simulink-based Battery Management System (BMS) for a 13S24P NMC 21700 lithium-ion pack...

## Features
- SoC Estimation (Coulomb Counting, Kalman Filtering)
- SoH Estimation (Capacity Fade, Resistance Growth)
- Fault Detection & Protection (Overvoltage, Undervoltage, Overcurrent, Short Circuit)
- Cell Balancing (Passive & Active)
- CC-CV Charging & Load Management
- Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Integration for Validation

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/13S24P_BMS_Simulation.git
   cd 13S24P_BMS_Simulation
